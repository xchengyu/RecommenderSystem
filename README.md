# Movie Recommender System Design

1. Recommended movies to user based on user’ s preference which is provided by Netflix.

2. Implemented four MapReduce jobs to chain the whole project and used MapReduce to merge matrixes.

3. Based on Item Collaborative Filtering algorithm and the data provided by Netflix, created user rating matrix which
contains users’ rates about the movies they have watched.

4. Acquired the movies’ Co-Occurrence Matrix by analyzing the data provided by Netflix and then merged this matrix
with user rating matrix to obtain the movie recommendation list.
